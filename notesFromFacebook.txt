Pawel:
Social sustainability we gotta include that in the paper
"is preserving social status quo always desirable?"

Excellent idea!

The more homogenous society gets the less government needs to interfere to maintain justice and order. When society becomes more unequal more regulation and intervention is needed (therefore, small government needs educated people and as limited an upper class as possible)
just an idea I had
I think it needs to go in the paper (though must, of course be explored more)

Paweł Dudek
We would ve to deal if counter argument of preserving ss many cultures as possible cos their ways may become useful in the future
Sort of the same argument as for preserving as many species as possible.cos their genes may b useful in the future

Just to record this, we should also talk about how the hansard (australia's collection of books detailing all legislation) should use versioning software (look at github, where i'd like Magnum Opus to be hosted for us) so that it is accessible all the time, it's managed, bills are pull requests (i.e. someone asks for a change)

Paweł Dudek
Kk don't really understand it but u ll explain it later, I guess its good idea to put here anything just for a record

11:59
Max Kaye

Hey Dude,
Register an account on this site: https://github.com
and let me know what your username is - I'll add you to the magnum opus contributors list so we can start recording ideas.
This site uses this thing called git with is really powerful versioning software. I'm still learning how to use it myself, but it's way, WAY more powerful than google docs.

GitHub · Social Coding
github.com
Git is an extremely fast, efficient, distributed version control system ideal for the collaborative development of software.

I feel like one of the things we really need to do with magnum opus is set down some fundamentals of government we (as in the world) can agree on
my suggestions: (came to me in a dream, srsly)
1. never police the innocent
2. from good actions come good values
3. Where possible, do not govern
it might be better to put 3 down as: where possible, avoid governance.
What I mean by that is don't interfere if it isn't necessary

Also, we should talk about the inherent inconsistencies of the 'user pays' idea

Even if a law isn't in and of itself racist or prejudice, we should be careful not to allow laws that facilitate the precipitation of latent racism (i.e.: don't make laws that let police be racist, like most drug convictions in the us being for black people, even though drug use is pretty uniform)
